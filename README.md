# FinalStandoff

## TopDown 2D Survival-Based game in C++ using OOP. Created by Aly Rahim Kazani, Syed Abrar Shah (@ThatOneIndieDev) and Izaan Khan(@izaankhan0).

### About the project
This project was developed over the course of three months by a group of second-semester undergraduates from FAST National University in Karachi, Pakistan. It is a fully-fledged top-down game built in C++ using the SFML library. Animations, sprites, and maps were sourced from free asset packs on Itch.io and skillfully integrated to create a visually engaging and immersive experience.

Exciting updates are still in development, including multiplayer support, expanded levels, new character types, open-world exploration, and much more. Stay tuned and follow us for the latest news and updates!
